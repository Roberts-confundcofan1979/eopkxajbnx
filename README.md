OMG, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the G20... honestly, it was a whole rollercoaster. Like, can we just talk about all those leaders trying to out-fashion each other? Sometimes it feels like a reality show more than a conference, haha. But seriously, some of their outfit choices had me questioning if they actually woke up, looked in the mirror, and said, “yep, that’s the one.” 🤷‍♀️

Anyway, aside from the literal parade of power suits, some of the discussions were, well, a mix of “ugh, not this again” and “oh wait, this is interesting.” You know what I mean? It’s like, sometimes I just wanna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   of all this diplomacy drama and skip to the good parts. Why does it feel like they’re always in a competition for who can use the most jargon? I get it, you're intelligent, but like, let's keep it real sometimes.

> In between the droning talks, I just kept daydreaming about new curtain designs for my living room. Anything to keep my brain from melting. Have you ever thought about how discussion tables could totally use a pop of color? Like, why are they always so dull? Maybe throw in some vibrant cushions or something... anything to add a bit of life, haha. 

Oh, and the environmental talks – here we go again, right? It’s like they’re just going in circles. Seriously though, one leader started talking, and I swear, I contemplated if it’s easier to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   of climate change debates on repeat rather than hearing them go on IRL. Ugh. But hey, at least some of them seem like they're kinda motivated to actually do something. Fingers crossed, I guess.

I think in the end, it’s always a mix of “we must do better” and “wow, that’s the best you could come up with, really?” But hey, they're trying, I suppose. I’m just glad I wasn’t the one stuck in those meetings for hours – can’t imagine staying awake through it all, haha. Alrighty, enough of my jibber-jabber. Time to go re-organize my bathroom towels, because priorities, amirite? 😆 Catch you later!
